        Favorite Restaurant: The Palms
    </h3>
    <p>
        I like <b>The Palms</b> partly due to their menu consisting of <b>unique food</b> choices such as blue cheese burgers, and fried pickles.
        Another reason I like the restaurant is because the portion sizes are massive and most the time I take home leftovers for a decent price.
        The last reason is I like the palms is that it isn't far from the college so I if I go out to eat with friends from college I don't have to drive far.
