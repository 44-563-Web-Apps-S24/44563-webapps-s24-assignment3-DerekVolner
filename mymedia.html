    An interesting fact about my favorite book is that the author followed the path of the actual story in real life across the United States living in multiple places near the historical
    events relayed in the mostly historically accurate novel Blood Meridian. Another interesting fact is that the main villain of the story is based off an actual person but that person's
    identity is somewhat up for debate as to the actual person that Judge Holden is so the real person outside of the story is also steeped in ambiguity as is the character.
    Another fact about Blood Meridian is that the author uses very minimal punctuation making it harder to read but allowing for the story to open itself up to more interpretation. 
    Another interesting thing about the book is that there isn't really a singular character in the main cast of characters in the Glanton gang that really have any outstanding qualities 
    that are not overshadowed by their horrendous actions that are primarily based on reality.

<p> My favorite movie is Blade runner 2049. Blade runner 2049 is a story about someone who is lost in life and looking partly for purpose. The main character named K finds meaning in 
    in a mystery he finds on a checkup of another android. K follows this meaning until he reaches the end of the mystery finding out that it doesn't strictly pertain to himself,
    rather this mystery points towards another character in the movie. K takes it upon himself to rescue someone in relation to this person and creates his own meaning and purpose after
    having been essentialy told his meaning and purpose he's been looking for doesn't matter and isn't for him.
